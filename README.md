What I created is a perosnal portfolio that showcases who I am as an individaul. I have blog posts, an about me section, a work section, and a lifestyle section. When you first copy the website into your browser and hit enter, an alert will pop up essentially welcoming you to my personal portfolio. You can click out of that and procced onto my personal portfolio!

You can hover your mouse over and click on each tab on the navigation bar to access different aspects of the website. Also the icons of Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tiktok will direct users to my social media platforms. If you wish to go back to my perosnal portfolio, simply hit the back arrow key and go back.

For the blog specifically, you can scroll and click on each blog topic. When you click on the blog topic, you will see the option to go through and look through more blog sections that pertain to that section if you so choose. You can go back to the blog page by clicking the blog page (at the top navigation bar).
